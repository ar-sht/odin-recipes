    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A delicious chicken marsala recipe that's easy to make!<br>Rights to <em>Allrecipes.com</em> for the recipe</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>3 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>3 cups buttermilk</li>
        <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>1/3 cup butter melted</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. In a separate bowl, beat together
        buttermilk, milk, eggs and melted butter. Keep the two mixtures separate until you are ready to cook.</li>

        <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. You can flick water across the surface and if it beads
        up and sizzles, it's ready!</li>

        <li>Pour the wet mixture into the dry mixture, using a wooden spoon or fork to blend. Stir until it's just blended together.
        Do not over stir! Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/2 cup for each pancake. Brown on both
        sides and serve hot.</li>
    </ol>
